# def main():

# def get_student():

# Classes

# Classes are a way by which, in object-oriented programming, we can create our own type of data and give them names
# A class is like a mold for a type of data ‚Äì where we can invent our own data type and give them a name


# We can modify our code as follows to implement our own class called Student
# Notice by convention that Student is capitalized
# class Student:
#     ...
#     # ... simply means that we will later return to finish that portion of our code


# def main():
#     student = get_student()
#     print(f"{student.name} from {student.house}")


# # we can create a student of class Student using the syntax student = Student()
# # notice that we utilize ‚Äúdot notation‚Äù to access attributes of this variable student of class Student
# def get_student():
#     student = Student()
#     student.name = input("Name: ")
#     student.house = input("House: ")
#     return student
#     # Any time you create a class and you utilize that blueprint to create something, you create what is called an ‚Äúobject‚Äù or an ‚Äúinstance‚Äù. In the case of our code, student is an object


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()


# Further, we can lay some groundwork for the attributes that are expected inside an object whose class is Student
# class Student:
#     def __init__(self, name, house):
#         self.name = name
#         self.house = house

#     # Notice that within Student, we standardize the attributes of this class
#     # We can create a function within class Student, called a ‚Äúmethod‚Äù, that determines the behavior of an object of class Student
#     # Within this function, it takes the name and house passed to it and assigns these variables to this object


# def main():
#     student = get_student()
#     print(f"{student.name} from {student.house}")


# def get_student():
#     name = input("Name: ")
#     house = input("House: ")
#     student = Student(name, house)
#     return student

#     # Further, notice how the constructor student = Student(name, house) calls this function within the Student class and creates a student. self refers to the current object that was just created


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()


# We can simplify our code as follows
# class Student:
#     def __init__(self, name, house):
#         self.name = name
#         self.house = house


# def main():
#     student = get_student()
#     print(f"{student.name} from {student.house}")


# def get_student():
#     name = input("Name: ")
#     house = input("House: ")
#     return Student(name, house)

#     # Notice how return Student(name, house) simplifies the previous iteration of our code where the constructor statement was run on its own line


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()


# Raise


# What if something goes wrong? What if someone tries to type in something random? What if someone tries to create a student without a name? Modify your code as follows
# class Student:
#     def __init__(self, name, house, patronus):
#         # Notice how we check now that a name is provided and a proper house is designated
#         # we can create our own exceptions that alerts the programmer to a potential error created by the user called raise
#         if not name:
#             raise ValueError("Missing name")
#         if house not in ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]:

#         self.patronus = patronus

#     def __str__(self):
#         return f"{self.name} from {self.house}"

#         # Notice how def __str__(self) provides a means by which a student is returned when called
#         # Therefore, you can now, as the programmer, print an object, its attributes, or almost anything you desire related to that object

#         # __str__ is a built-in method that comes with Python classes. It just so happens that we can create our own methods for a class as well

#     # In this case, we define our charm method where specific cases have specific results

# Decorators
# Properties can be utilized to harden our code

# In Python, we define properties using function ‚Äúdecorators‚Äù, which begin with @
# class Student:
#     def __init__(self, name, house):
#         if not name:
#             raise ValueError("Invalid name")
#         self.name = name
#         self.house = house

#     def __str__(self):
#         return f"{self.name} from {self.house}"


#     # Getter for house
#     @property
#     def house(self):
#         return self._house

#     # Notice how we‚Äôve written @property above a function called house
#     # Doing so defines house as a property of our class
#     # With house as a property, we gain the ability to define how some attribute of our class, _house, should be set and retrieved

#     # Setter for house
#     @house.setter
#     def house(self,house):
#         if house not in ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]:
#             raise ValueError("Invalid house")
#         self._house = house

#     # Indeed, we can now define a function called a ‚Äúsetter‚Äù, via @house.setter, which will be called whenever the house property is set‚Äîfor example, with student.house = "Gryffindor"
#     # Here, we‚Äôve made our setter validate values of house for us
#     # Notice how we raise a ValueError if the value of house is not any of the Harry Potter houses, otherwise, we‚Äôll use house to update the value of _house

#     # Why _house and not house? house is a property of our class, with functions via which a user attempts to set our class attribute
#     # _house is that class attribute itself. The leading underscore, _, indicates to users they need not (and indeed, shouldn‚Äôt!) modify this value directly. _house should only be set through the house setter
#     # Notice how the house property simply returns that value of _house, our class attribute that has presumably been validated using our house setter

#     # When a user calls student.house, they‚Äôre getting the value of _house through our house ‚Äúgetter‚Äù


# def main():
#     student = get_student()
