# Note: The 'assert' statements check if the expressions following them are True.
# If they are True, the program proceeds without any issue.
# If any of the expressions are False, an AssertionError will be raised with a specific message.
# This makes it useful for testing since it stops the execution immediately when an assertion fails,
# helping to identify the exact point of failure in the test case.
